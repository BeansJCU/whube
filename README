Hey there hotshot. Are you part of the GNU Generation? Do you listen
to Black Moth Super Rainbow? The Octopus Project? Blockhead? Air?
Have you owned a Che T-Shirt? Programmed before you could drive?
Been outside in the last two weeks? Seen the sun?

Yeah? Good. Read on. No? Go play with Bugzilla and Perl! ;)

Still with us? Kickass. Whube is a bug tracker for us hipster nerds.
Not real hipster, because they are lame, but cool hipster. Like trendy
kickass nerd. Not to mention the first release of Whube sucked ass.
This one is way better ( That was a hipser joke, yes ),

There are enough of those "Bug tracking made simple" or "braindead simple"
or "Defect tracking made easy". Whube's not simple. Well, not *that* simple.
We try and be easy-to-use, but we can handle anything. Plugins and everything.

So. If you need to manage some tix, and want a bit of humor in your
management, Whube's your new toy.

     Viva la Hacking!

===================        TECHNICAL SHIT          =====================
========================================================================

What you will need:
  * GNU/Linux 
     ( I'm sure you could get this to work with windows, but that's
       just all kinds of dumb. Don't use nonfree crap.
       PLUG: USE UBUNTU! IT WORKS GREAT! <3 UBUNTU!                 )

  * Apache2
     ( Anything that supports the .htaccess file in the root, with
       rewrite rules.                                               )

  * PHP
     ( Well, the whole thing is written in PHP. If you ported this
       chances are it's not Whube anymore. Ship of Theseus kinda 
       thing. Although this is not the forum for such talk          )

  * MySQL
     ( Out of any of the things above, this is the most flexible. 
       All you have to do is rewrite model/sql.php to work with 
       whatever SQL server you fancy. Rewrite dbobj if you don't
       want SQL. Although that, is kinda dumb.                      )

  * Some projects
     ( Can't have a bug tracker against no project. Dingus.         )
