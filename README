Hey there hotshot. Are you part of the GNU Generation? Do you listen
to Black Moth Super Rainbow? The Octopus Project? Blockhead? Air?
Have you owned a Che T-Shirt? Programmed before you could drive?
Been outside in the last two weeks? Seen the sun ( although that
is really not the best metric. One of the devs is up in Alaska.
He won't see sun for twenty weeks at a time. )


Yeah? Good. Read on. No? Go play with Bugzilla and Perl! ;)


Still with us? Kickass. Whube is a bug tracker for us hipster nerds.
Not real hipster, because they are lame, but cool hipster. Like trendy
I-still-see-daylight nerd. Not to mention the first release of Whube
sucked ass. This one is way better.

Chances are you have a decent computer, and can run Javascript. Whube
can't work without JS. For the record: NO, IT'S NOT BECAUSE I LIKE IT.
It was the only way I could do any kind of encryption over raw HTTP. 
Suck it up Sally. Is your name Sally? Then suck it up Nancy.


So. If you need to manage some tix, and want a bit of humor in your
management, Whube's your new toy. 

     Viva la Hacking!

===================        TECHNICAL SHIT          =====================
========================================================================

What you will need:
  * GNU/Linux 
     ( I'm sure you could get this to work with windows, but that's
       just all kinds of dumb. Don't use nonfree crap.
       PLUG: USE UBUNTU! IT WORKS GREAT! <3 UBUNTU!                 )

  * Apache2
     ( Anything that supports the .htaccess file in the root, with
       rewrite rules.                                               )

  * PHP
     ( Well, the whole thing is written in PHP. If you ported this
       chances are it's not Whube anymore. Ship of Theseus kinda 
       thing. Although this is not the forum for such talk          )

  * MySQL
     ( Out of any of the things above, this is the most flexible. 
       All you have to do is rewrite model/sql.php to work with 
       whatever SQL server you fancy. Rewrite dbobj if you don't
       want SQL. Although that, is kinda dumb.                      )

  * Some projects
     ( Can't have a bug tracker against no project. Dingus.         )

===================             SETUP              =====================
========================================================================
#
# Setup should be easy enough. Feel free to copy paste, although
# if you can't figure this out, chances are you should not be doing it
#  :)
#
#   -- Paul
#
# Run the install/install.sql script against your MySQL server. 
cd install
mysql -u root -p < ./install.sql # this runs as MySQL user 'root'.
# configure the site
cd ../conf/
# Be sure to edit all the options to taste! SITE_PREFIX IS CRITICAL!
vim site.php
# All set :) Give it a test!
